# Auc:Stat:WoWuction

This is an effort to make the [auc-stat-wowuction](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/auc-stat-wowuction)
addon working in WoW MoP 5.4.x.

Due to recent changes in TSM's API and naming schemes, auc-stat-wowuction neither loads properly, nor
pulls any data out of TSM_WoWuction. Instead, it throws an exception.

**This repository provides a working version of the Auc:Stat:WoWuction module for the WoW Client 5.4.8!**

## How to install

1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/alexdo/auc-stat-wowuction/releases
1. Extract it into your `<WoW>/Interface/AddOns` folder, *overwriting all existing files*.
1. Happy Auctioning!


## Credits

Many thanks go out to Sapu94, the lead developer of TSM, who pointed me at the proper TSM APIs.  
And, of course, thanks to Johnny C. Lam and Chris Hennick for creating this addon in the first place.
